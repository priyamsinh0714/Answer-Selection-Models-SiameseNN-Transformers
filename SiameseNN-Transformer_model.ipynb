    "# Assignment 3 Part 2 - Find complex answers to medical questions\n",

    "*Submission deadline: Friday 1 November 2024, 11:55pm.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assessment marks: 20 marks (20% of the total unit assessment)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless a Special Consideration request has been submitted and approved, a 5% penalty (of the total possible mark of the task) will be applied for each day a written report or presentation assessment is not submitted, up until the 7th day (including weekends). After the 7th day, a grade of ‘0’ will be awarded even if the assessment is submitted. For example, if the assignment is worth 8 marks (of the entire unit) and your submission is late by 19 hours (or 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds), 0.4 marks (5% of 8 marks) will be deducted. If your submission is late by 24 hours (or 47 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds), 0.8 marks (10% of 8 marks) will be deducted, and so on. The submission time for all uploaded assessments is 11:55 pm. A 1-hour grace period will be provided to students who experience a technical concern. For any late submission of time-sensitive tasks, such as scheduled tests/exams, performance assessments/presentations, and/or scheduled practical assessments/labs, please apply for [Special Consideration](https://students.mq.edu.au/study/assessment-exams/special-consideration).\n",

    "In assignment 3 you will work on a general answer selection task. Given a question and a list of sentences, the final goal is to predict which of these sentences from the list can be used as part of the answer to the question. Assignment 3 is divided into two parts. Part 1 will help you get familiar with the data, and Part 2 requires you to implement deep neural networks.\n",

    "The data is in the file `train.csv`, which is provided in both GitHub repository and in iLearn. Each row of the file consists of a question ('qtext' column), an answer ('atext' column), and a label ('label' column) that indicates whether the  answer is correctly related to the question (1) or not (0).\n",
